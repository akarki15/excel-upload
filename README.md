# demere

### Live preview:
- You can view the webapp running at my private server. Go to this url: http://45.55.92.219/

### Setup:
- Clone this repo. 
- `cd demere`
- Install dependencies: 
  `python setup.py install` 
- Setup sqlite database: `python database.py`
- Run the python server: `python server.py`
- The server should be now running at `localhost:5000`

### Test uploads:
- Folder `test uploads` contains sample excel files that can be uploaded to the website. Instead of actual image links, I have used sample blank images from `placehold.it`
